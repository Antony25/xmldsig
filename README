Version 1

xmldsig is cryptographic key implementation agnostic.  xmldsig is not
a complete implementation of http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig. See
module documentation for details.

===

Example:

>>> signed_xml = xmldsig.sign(xml, f_private, mod, exp)
... is_verified = xmldsig.verify(signed_xml, f_public, mod)

See test.py for sample use.

Commentary:

XMLDSIG is a ridiculous but necessary protocol for identification and
authentication in computer systems. Why is XMLDSIG ridiculous? The
defining feature of XML is that its exact bytestring of the message is
arbitrary. The defining feature of a cryptographic signature is that
the exact bytestring of the message is critical. Only by what I can
imagine to be some "practical man's" increasingly pathetic sophistry
to assert himself over the ideas which he derides as "of no practical
importance" could two such elegant ideas be so crudely forced together
and then ---with so much energy--- propped, pushed, and defended.
